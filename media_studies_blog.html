	<p>Why am I taking this course?</p>

	<p>After watching the first lecture on web option, I have come to a decision of continuing to take this course. So, the better question is, just why am I taking this course anyway? This is going to be the topic of my first blog post.</p>

	<p>As a second year computer science student, people have to understand that it is extremely harder to achieve a higher GPA than a humanities or business students. I know some people don't want to say this, but in general people choosing electives are looking for that easy "bird course". I understand that too, because that is exactly how I approach an elective course myself.</p>

	<p>The reason why I am staying in this course though is because I realized that I am a very practical person. I am not someone who would enjoy taking a theoretical and/or abstract course that has nothing to do with our everyday lives.</p>

	<p>So how does MDSA01 relate to the real world? Well, from the overall course syllabus and course textbook, the book is very practical on the social challenges people face every day. It's funny, because if someone were to ask you were the course is about, people will automatically assume it is about popular culture and the news. This course is about that, but what interests me are the effects of what the media does to people and how people change based on the media.</p>

	<p>What do I hope to get out of this course though? Even though I am a mathematics and computer science person, I love learning about social and political aspects of human life. Just by flipping through the textbook I can already see some of the interesting topics that we are going to talk about this semester. For example, the first chapter on Marxism, its history and its effect on history. This is already a very interesting topic to read about because this relates to Maoism and the large foundation of my people and culture.</p>

	<p>I don't want to talk too much about the boring stuff on how my ancestors fought in civil wars and the conflicts between Taiwan and China, but I just want to restate the point that I'm keeping this course on my list because this course seems interesting and I hope to learn more media and the effects of media.</p>

	<p>What is media?</p>

	<p>This was a question talked about in class and I'm not going to do any research or any readings from the course to answer this question. This blog post will be about me trying to define media in my own words. Maybe after three months I will look back and see how my perspective differs.</p>

	<p>Before I start, I just want to say that it's ironic that what I'm about to say will probably be based off of the media that has surrounded throughout my generation. I think this blog post will kind be like a time capsule too since what I think three months from now is probably going to be way different.</p>

	<p>Let's see, in my opinion media is the short-term culture that people look to. What do I mean by that? Let's take Gangnam style for example; when that video went viral, everyone started doing the dance. However, after a short period of time people stopped and it just kind of went away from everyone's daily lives. So in other words, short-term culture is really "what is currently the most popular thing that everyone is doing". </p>

	<p>Let's look another example, how about phones, video games, or movies? Every single year there would be some hype about the newest something. Let's take movies, people watch it once in theaters, and after that people forget about it. I remember when Avatar the movie came out, all my friends watched it and said it was awesome, but after 2 weeks no one talked about it ever again. And here's a good one, Inception, it was such a great movie and till this day people still use the world "inception" when doing something like point filming another person filming you. Look at it today in 2013, the world inception is rarely used.</p>

	<p>So I guess that is what I think of media. The viral videos, the T.V news, the latest technology, the latest "thing", that is how I view the word media. I am really curious to read the textbook tonight and see if I got the right answer.</p>

	<p>Old School Classical Chinese Music is DYING!</p>

	<p>As most of my friends know, I love listening to Zhong Guo Feng(中国风) songs. I will be referring to that as ZGF for short. Basically, this style uses the traditional instruments like the guqin, pipa, and guzheng. These instruments were invented almost 2 thousand years ago and are still used today. But why do I all of a sudden want to talk about this topic? Well, the lecture and readings this week referred to Marxism, Marxism then led to me thinking about my people's revolution. And when I thought of the 1945-1949 civil wars in China, I couldn't help but wonder what a music people listened to back then. Here is another question though, how do I know what music people listened to back then in China in the 1950s? It's easy, that source is my grandparents.</p>

	<p>Here is the thing though and there is no other way to say this, except that classical Chinese music is no longer in the mainstream media (there are exceptions but I will mention later). When my grandparents grew up, all they listened to were just the sound of classic Chinese instruments, occasional you would go to a bar or a live showing of bands of old school geezers with a pipa all in one unison.</p>

	<p>Nowadays, even Chinese people don't know what a guqin or pipa is or what ZGF even is. Why is that? It is because the Chinese media is flooded with westernized music. How do I know that? Everyone in China knows who Justin Bieber is, and everyone in Taiwan knows who Lady GaGa is. The point of this blog post is really show that what Chinese teenagers listen to now is not in Chinese and even some of the older people who listen to music would not listen to any of the older styles.</p>

	<p>ZGF style really is dying, however artists like Jay Chou, JJ Lin, and Wang LeeHom are keeping it alive, and I thank them dearly. Here's a couple of old school songs with a modern twist.</p>

	<p>My thoughts on "Worst Twerk Fail Ever - Girl Catches on Fire" prank</p>

	<p>I just want to first of all say that Jimmy Kimmel and that Stuntwoman did an excellent job. When I saw the raw footage posted on video I actually thought it was real. And for the people that do not want to watch the video to know what happened, I'll explain. Basically Jimmy Kimmel and Daphune (the stuntwoman) both made a stunt video of a girl twerking and failing miserably and posted it up on the internet only to show everyone that it was not accident, it was a setup.</p>

	<p>This social experiment revealed one very important concept to me about the media in our lives. The concept is that media is deceiving and believing in the media is easy. Like Jimmy said in the video, this was a complete setup which granted him over 10 million views in about a week. So my thoughts on this experiment asks what if every viral video is all a setup? People know that you can make very good money from Google AdSense alone, not to mention the extra endorsements people get when they are famous.</p>

	<p>If you are not too clear on what I just said, here's what I mean. Every youtuber on YouTube is trying to make it big, all you need is 1 viral video and you are on your way to a solid subscriber base. But what if someone who is a comedian on YouTube is trying to make it big but is not seeing a lot of success in his YouTube career? He can either grind videos out slowly or gain a slow steady subscription rate or he can pretend to do a fake prank or fail video that can get him hundreds or even millions of views instantly</p>

	<p>Here is a good example, is his brother faking it?</p>

	<p>This leads me to thinking if some youtubers on YouTube are actually themselves. Granted that you are there to entertain people, but when youtubers pretend to be someone who they are not and are doing it for the money and fan base, it becomes demoralizing for me when I watch a good YouTube video.</p>

	<p>So what is the moral of this blog? Do not trust the media. If you do, beware of what you are really hearing.</p>

	<p>Sharing is Caring: The Facebook Culture!</p>

	<p>It's hard to believe that Facebook has already been out for almost 10 years. Facebook is has so much to the world, it has changed the media and the way we share and communicate with each other.</p>

	<p>What I want to talk about today is the evolution of sharing stuff on the web. It was not too long ago when people were afraid of exposing themselves all over the internet. Ten years ago, nobody would have openly took pictures of themselves and put them up on the internet for everyone to see ten. But somehow Facebook has made everyone open to sharing their personal lives. People today would post a message on their wall or upload a photo from their cell phones onto Facebook without ever considering privacy. People nowadays do it because it's what everyone would do.</p>

	<p>Something else I want to talk about is the influence of Facebook on other media. Because of Facebook and its culture of sharing with everyone, there are so many more people willing to share on different platforms. Let's take for example vlogging (video blogging), a decade ago, if someone were to point their camera to themselves while talking would seem absurd. Now, and especially in places like California, Youtubers all over the world would vlog about their adventures. Although it might seem weird still to some people, it is slowly becoming a hit.</p>

	<p>I don't need don't need to mention other sites like Instagram, Twitter, Google+, and Tumblr. These social networks derive from Facebook and were influenced by Facebook through one connection, and that is "SHARING" everything about yourself on the internet.</p>

	<p>College and University in the Public Eye</p>

	<p>The question of the day is: Why do people think that College or University education is mandatory?</p>

	<p>Let's look at how the "media" portrays everything. Basically in every teen drama or television show that comes out, I always see the characters in the show mentioning something about college fund, a good reputable school, and needing a higher education just because. I know I'm being quite vague, but you should know what I'm trying to say. The point is that all the movies nowadays tell people that you need a degree to be successful and if you don't have one, then you won't be.</p>

	<p>Now back to the question.</p>

	<p>So media in our everyday lives has a big influence on us on getting a better education, but what about the exact opposite? When do you ever see a T.V show or a movie that would portray a character who does not wish to go to college or university in a positive fashion? You will rare find a scene where the kid's parents say "We will support whatever you do in life". Can you think of one show where parents were positive towards a kid choosing to not pursue further education? </p>

	<p>Let's see some that I can think of. Jessie Pinkman from Breaking Bad, he got kicked out of his house, but his 10 year old smart brother is treated as a piece of art. How about Will from Good Will Hunting? He was seen as a waste of talent who should have gone to college or university. Finally, there's the Secret Life of the American Teenager where everyone applied for college except Henry. Just because he did not want to go, Ben and Alice questioned him immensely as to why and said he was making a big mistake.</p>

	<p>So there you have it, today's media and how it affects all of our lives, including mine. Post-secondary education is important but why do it just for a piece of paper and thousands of dollars of debt?</p>

	<p>I Hate "Double Standards" for Men</p>

	<p>I recently watched a short film by WongFuProductions on YouTube. It was about the unwritten rules of which person pays for dinner at the end of a date.</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGkdUEHa7sI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGkdUEHa7sI</a></p>

	<p>You guessed! The guy in the video was expected to pay for both, however this time the girl in the video took into consideration of the guy's financial situation. Even though the girl did not pay for dinner, the guy did not pay for it either. I don't want to spoil everything, so you can go watch it for yourself; it's a great piece of short film.</p>

	<p>This video reminded me of just how much I hated the unwritten double standards we have currently in our society. The thing that I want to address though is that it is true the media portrays women wanting to be equal and more like men, but does it really? This video is a perfect example that shows the media wants people to believe women are equal in many ways, but in reality are not. Let me tell everyone something, women and their image of the media is all a LIE!</p>

	<p>I found another video here:</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWBHD6oTJIA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWBHD6oTJIA</a></p>

	<p>This video really shows what happens in our everyday lives. If watched the whole thing, you would know that even the cop admitted to being more lenient on the women than the man. </p>

	<p>This video shows just how women are able to use the system to their advantage. Why is it that when a woman is abused, she has the ability to refer to equality and equal rights to men? Why is it that when men are abused by women that these rights don't apply? Even if a man was to defend himself against an abusive woman, he would probably go to jail instead. If you are a man, then the next time you encounter this type of situation just remember to do what this guy did.</p>

	<p>What is a T.V?</p>

	<p>Taking this course, I have realized that I have not had cable television for almost 8 years. That is actually according to my calculations (about) 3 to 4 thousand dollars saved over my life time by not paying for television. Why did I bring this up? Well it's simple because I was one of the very few people that started watching more videos on the internet than on T.V. Back in 2006, I switched exclusively to watching cartoons and anime on YouTube and other sites. While all my friends did not know about YouTube or did not like the 240p it had to offer, I was just so excited at the fact that entertainment was now at my own hands and not at the hands of the day or the week.</p>

	<p>I want to talk about how media and the way in which we entertain and communicate in our society have changed in the past decade.</p>

	<p>Let's start with the T.V, honestly who really cares about the T.V anymore? If you were born after the 1980s then it is safe to say that you have almost completely transitioned to watching movies, videos and everything on the internet and the computer. There is no reason for you to watch a show on T.V when you can just download it all online (legally or illegally) and watch it anytime and anywhere in one sitting.</p>

	<p>And then there's the phone. If you told me a decade ago that I would be able to do almost everything I can on a computer on a small handheld device, I would laughed at you. However, the phone has now become an extension of you as a person. Everyone has a smartphone now. It's cheap and it's efficient at getting things done. Just like the computer, you can watch movies, videos, play games and even take pictures or send texts instantly. What would you have? A big lump of T.V that is built only for one function or a phone built for multiple functions?</p>

	<p>So there we go, the T.V is no more, all you need in life now is a phone and a laptop computer and you are all set to go. The media has changed, even advertisers nowadays do not turn to T.V channels to get the word of their product out, they have YouTube, Google, and many small websites online to help to market their products. </p>

	<p>To end this blog, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that I predict in next 10 to 15 years, the T.V will disappear, just like the FAX machine (Seriously I still don't know what a Fax machine looks like).</p>

	<p>Music has changed in the past 5 years</p>

	<p>Do people remember the All American Rejects? They were a popular band that became famous due to their hit singles <i>Move Along</i>, <i>Dirty Little Secret</i>, and <i>Gives You Hell. </i>What about other bands like Simple Plan or Fall Out Boy? And wait, what about Linkin Park?</p>

	<p>If you go to the top 100 Billboard charts today in 2013, all you will see are Miley Cyrus, Katty Perry, or Justin Bieber. From what I remembered Linkin Park used to be one of the most popular bands that consistently appeared in the top 100 Billboard. So what happened Linkin Park and all those other bands who were once popular?</p>

	<p>The answer to this question is very simple. Music has changed.</p>

	<p>People no longer want to listen to "slow" music anymore. People today want to listen to fast beat music and songs that are about money, sex, nudity, or shallow love. </p>

	<p>Let's compare <i>Gives You Hell</i>, which debuted as the #2 song on the Billboard charts in 2008 upon release. And yes I was one of the first few that listened to this amazing song.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxUATkpMQ8A">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxUATkpMQ8A</a></p>

	<p>Now let's look at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/artist/lady-gaga?feature=watch_video_title">Lady Gaga</a>'s song<i> Applause. -</i>a great example of nudity</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pco91kroVgQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pco91kroVgQ</a></p>

	<p>What do you notice? First, people want to see more nudity. Second there is a cut in between every half second in the music video. And third, it is almost impossible for me to identity what instruments were played in the background. What I have found out though was that while was listening, I had intention of wanting to learn the lyrics or any of the meaning of the song. While listening to that song, my mind was in a state in which all I did was listen and did not think. The music was just "catchy" and a very temporary source of entertainment.</p>

	<p>Not thinking, that is exactly what today's music has made everyone do. This pop music culture has created a generation where people listen to music at a very shallow level. When people only had the option of listening to 10 or 20 songs back then, it was more about taking the time to listen and enjoy a good piece of literature. Nowadays, music is all but music to the ears and nothing in the mind.</p>

	<p>I don't speak Le French</p>

	<p>Learning French has been a big part of my life. I remember having the first day of class in Canada where I learned French before English. Since then I have learned French for more than a decade. I'm writing this blog right now while studying for a French test: my very first university level French test that I'm going to take this Thursday that is. I just had question in my head of "Why did I spend all this time learning this language???".</p>

	<p>I did a little bit of research on the topic of what was the most dominant language. Of course right now it has to be English, but more than a thousand years ago, it was French. It's hard to believe that French was the dominant language that most people looked up to back then. Whatever happened to French though? Why is it that there are only about 200 million people that speak French while more than a billion can speak English? So I did a little bit of digging and here is what I found out.</p>

	<p>French was the dominant language until the British started control more than one fifth of the world. If you look at the maps of the French colonies and the British colonies, it would be pretty obvious. But, the biggest cause of the disappearance of the French language is due to the British overtaking the French in around the 18<sup>th</sup> century. </p>

	<p>But Wait! What does this have anything to do with media? Well, I found it interesting to learn some of the history of the languages because the world today was heavily influence by what had happened in the past. The reason why we are not all speaking French right now and it is due to what the British had done in the past.</p>

	<p>It is interesting to realize that the medium in which we communicate (that is the English language) was determined by people that wanted more land and power. </p>

	<p>The Startup Culture is the New Culture</p>

	<p>I wanted to talk about the difference between the work-culture of traditional companies vs. current startup companies. I was very hesitant on about touching this subject because I have not yet officially made a startup of my own. However being an entrepreneur by heart, I wanted to really give my 2 cents on why I think more fresh and new companies are staying away from the old corporate ladder and more towards a system of meritocracy. I will mainly breakdown the "technology" companies because most startups today are almost all related to providing a web or app service or something online.</p>

	<p>Let's startup off with a company that has been founded for many years, and that company would be Microsoft. The way people do things at Microsoft is done very similar to any other "old" companies, where seniority matters more than a person's skill. A good example of this is how Microsoft fails to develop a truly reputable internship program like Google or Facebook. Even people on Glassdoor.com say that Microsoft has way too many managers and way too little developers. When looking at software development, people who are good project managers are not always good developers. It would almost be impossible for Microsoft to accept say a 24 year old software engineer as a project manager. In reality only developers can be project managers for a software project.</p>

	<p>Why is it that when people think of Microsoft, all they can think of are people over the age of 30? But when they think of Facebook, it's always people in their twenties or people who are competent enough to do their jobs right.</p>

	<p>Speaking of Facebook, it is truly a magical place (having reading so many wonderful reviews and having asked some of my friends in the states). It was also ranked the number one place to work at on Glassdoor.com. But why is it that Facebook has such a higher reputation in terms of their say internship programs and interviews? First of all Facebook is not a place for only youngsters, there are a variety of different people who work there. The one thing I see and hear consistently is that people are not restricted to the "upper level management" in most companies. Employees have a say in everything and are often rewarded immediately for their own efforts. Interns are not just "interns" because they are treated as another professional and equal.</p>

	<p>Facebook and Google are similar companies in which they look more into your own skills and personality rather than certifications or a degree. They are more interested in how you can approach a problem rather than having flawless syntactical memory of a particular programming language. In short, I feel as if Microsoft is going to die out, if one day Google, Facebook, or another big company decides to make a completely new operating system, then Microsoft would be finished for good. I mean what else do they have? The Xbox 720?</p>

	<p>I don't want to major in debt!</p>

	<p>So here's the video that I watched last night:</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcSYrPx3Ao">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPcSYrPx3Ao</a></p>

	<p>In short, the video sends a message to everyone that college and universities are not worth going to, or if you are planning to get a higher education you should do with careful planning.</p>

	<p>I think we love in a world today where people are finally starting to understand that one does not need a degree to get a job. This generation (the digital natives) in particular are well aware of what the internet can do. I think the media today is actually starting to encourage people to go to universities less and less. If you disagree with me because you think Obama thinks every should get higher education then I have no comments.</p>

	<p>Being only in my second year in university, I have actually done quite a lot of research online about this "debt" situation. From my experience of asking my friends, searching the web, and reading other people's stories, the main point I found was that people just make stupid decisions when they are young.</p>

	<p>What do I mean by that? I think this is where the North American culture really sucks hard. I mean you are barely an 18 year old adult entering the real world not knowing what you really want to do with your life and all of a sudden 10 thousand dollars is given to you. What does these 10 thousand dollars really mean to someone who has never earned or had before in their own possession? NOTHING! Someone who has not earned 10 thousand dollars should not be given 10 thousand dollars to begin with. I really do not understand why the government would give such a huge amount of loans to students when there are other small businesses in need of such money.</p>

	<p>The main problem with student loan debt is not how much money the universities are charging, but it is how the government is lending such huge amounts to young and naïve individuals that have no idea how the world works.</p>

	<p>I myself have spent months during my last year in high school researching about this, and I made every possible right decision that could help me lower my student debt. I know that I sound like a person that might not understand everything about the world yet, but at least I'm trying to be smart about my future. I mean I really cannot imagine myself still paying back student loan money when I'm 47(video reference).</p>

	<p>What University has really taught me</p>

	<p>What university has taught me is to not "think". </p>

	<p>I know being a computer science major implies that we do a bunch of problems that involves lots "thinking", it in reality it doesn't!</p>

	<p>What university has taught me is really the art of following instructions and being a good employee. Well, that might sound extremely practical as everyone that has a regular job in the real world would be rewarded for following instructions all the time. But that's the thing; the traditional route of being told what to do and doing what is being told is starting to get old. Although that will always exist to a certain degree, universities bring that to a whole new level.</p>

	<p>I remember several times when I really did not agree with the terminologies discussed in class, but when faced with those questions on a test I had to answer it based on what was told to me during lecture. One time I was in management class and the teacher told us that universities are not a business but a public organization. Let's be real, that's a bunch of crap.</p>

	<p>Now on with my computer science course, I find it quite unrealistic that a project can be so fixed at times where "being told what to do" was the reason why I was programming the first place. There is one thing I hate the most in the world, and that is being a code monkey. Someone who codes specifications to perfection but is never able to communicate or have a say in a project is useless in my opinion. For these so called software development courses to be unique, it should be dynamic. It should be a general project assigned to everyone, almost like a Hackathon style of teaching where people use what they learned and really apply it into a personalized project.</p>

	<p>Before I finish my rant, I just to say that in the future I will look back and say "Boy were those the good old times" but that would refer to my experience meeting new friends and not my projects and midterms.</p>

	<p>A heart is what?</p>

	<p>Have you ever wondered why a symbolic way of showing a heart is completely different from the actual shape of the heart? I got thinking the other while watching an episode of Grey's Anatomy when Cristina said "A heart used for nothing except to pump". Why do people associate with that symbol when they are talking about love? We'll I did some research and here's what I found. I'm going to keep this blog short so here it goes.</p>

	<p>It all started around the middle ages when people started using the symbol to depict "love". Reasons why the heart is shaped the way it is right now is due to certain human parts (only a theory, I don't for sure).</p>

	<p>It was around the 1850s when the heart became written in stone; Valentine's Day used the heart symbol to show love. What interests me was how this might have been what continued the heart shape as being what it is now. Valentine's Day evolved into a day where people express their love to each other. The medium in which people do that have changed but expressing "love" in general was the reason for Valentine's Day's existence.</p>

	<p>This was the main turning point in history where the symbol became universal in the North American and European areas. This made me think why the symbol for love is really not used too much in Asian cultures. Although I might be wrong, but looking back in time, I never remember watching any original Chinese cartoons that would use the heart symbol. For example if a cartoon character is attracted to another cartoon character in the show, their eyes would not have hearts.</p>

	<p> Life of a Developer</p>

	<p>I read an article the other day (I can't find it for some reason I'm sorry!) where it talked about the life span of programmers/software developers were as short as athletes. At first I thought that it was ridiculous to think that this was the case. But after a minute of thinking about it, I realized that it is true, programmers or at least younger programmers are far more superior to older ones. Yes, I did get that from Mark Zuckerberg, but it doesn't change the fact that this is true.<br />
	<br />
	My thought on this topic is very simple, I'm young and I can choose to do whatever I want. This isn't just a statement of ignorance and not thinking about my long term future, my point of view is that this is similar to becoming an athlete. When I turn 30 - 35 years old, I will be like any athlete start another career (yes, I'm talking about management positions).<br />
	<br />
	In this blog, I don't want to talk about my thoughts though; I really want to relate to more of why software developers' life spans are so damn short! We'll let's start by thinking of the medium in which we work in, it is NOT an organized structure based on seniority but rather meritocracy. So just because I've been at a school mopping floors for 20 years doesn't mean that I should make more money than the other guy who does the same thing as me. Programming is based off of pure problem solving skills. The better one is at problem solving the more opportunities one gets in life.<br />
	<br />
	Let's face it, people get slower when they get old, just like athletes, coders become slower at typing and have mentally less stamina. By stamina, I mean going on 3-4 days without sleep during a Hackathon, because really that's what the industry asks for after all correct? The only difference though is experience; however, what good is 10 years of experience when someone who has only 3 - 4 years of experience can do it faster than you and better than you with newer technology? <br />
	<br />
	So why is it that the nature of this industry seems so unfair? Well If you didn't know, learning all the programming concepts do not take too long. In actuality I think if someone were to spend 4 years in university only taking software design courses, that person would have almost all the knowledge needed for real life team projects. The only thing that the person would like is just experience in working for a real company that would use the code they produce as a product. In actuality, after 3 -4 years of programming experience, one cannot improve anymore simply through "learning" more concepts. It all comes down to who can think the fastest and who can naturally outperform another.<br />
	<br />
	Reason why this happens is because someone who works extremely hard will eventually see that there is not enough hours in the day. Everyone that does software development whether intelligent or not would always spend every waking second coding. When time is put out of the picture, these non-intellectual people or grinders as I might like to call them are not able to outperform the naturally gifted guys.<br />
	<br />
	So in summation, I have one to say, and that is: "Work hard now, and retire when you are 30".</p>

	<p> Why Shows get Cancelled</p>

	<p>Have you ever wondered why some GREAT television shows get cancelled even though some rake in a ton of viewership and a ton of money for a company? Well, I have not done any research on any of this, but here is what I think:<br />
	<br />
	1. A show will cancel just by the decline of views. WHY??? Because if your show is never going to grow, what is the point of continuing the show? Think about it, even though you are consistently gaining 10 million views for each episode of a show, if there is no potential to grow whatsoever then it does not seem like it is worth it to continue putting a ton of effort to making the show better despite having a high view count.<br />
	<br />
	2. Writers run out of ideas and start to BS their way through the show, the show will most of the time lose viewers. Enough said.<br />
	<br />
	3. A show just becomes outdated; remember those slow dramas back in 2000? Well, think now to YouTube videos, how many cuts are there in a single video? Movies nowadays are following this trend. Nothing is suspenseful or "slow" as before. Everything now is all flashy and action-packed because we live in a generation of bit-size pieces. This means people get bored if nothing happens on the screen.<br />
	<br />
	4. Someone dies. Yes, I am talking about Glee. If you do not know what I am talking about then you must be living under a rock.<br />
	<br />
	5. No one wants 10 seasons of friends anymore. People want to see a show that lasts anywhere between 3-5 seasons. why might you ask? Come on, people just want to find out what happens, they do not want to watch fluff. A good example of this is Breaking Bad. It was compact and there were no fillers. 5 Seasons was perfect. A bad example of this is Grey`s Anatomy, this show is so repetitive that I cannot believe people are still watching it. The show should just end already like House MD and Scrubs.</p>

	<p>Why this Generation is the Generation of "Change"</p>

	<p>About 3 year ago I was able to meet with my grandparents again. After not seeing them for over a decade, they moved here and lived over here for about 3 months during the summer. You know how old people love to tell stories about themselves? Well, they were no different from the norm. But when it came time to try something new or anything that was closer to the years 2000 and onward, they had nothing to talk about.</p>

	<p>What did I think at that very moment of them? I thought that they were retired and had nothing to do all day but just hang around and chill out. I mean they worked hard throughout their lives, now it's time to sit back and chill. However, now that I have become more matured, I realized that they both resisted change. How this does related to media studies though???</p>

	<p>I realized the medium in which we communicate over the last decade evolved tremendously. I'm talking about where there was a time in our lives where having phones was a big deal. Also, when people still used MSN messenger. This was around the era in which I grew up in. So through this medium I realized that our generation (the digital natives) has probably experienced more change in our second half of a decade in our lives than any grandparent ever had.</p>

	<p>Today, my thoughts are kind of scattered everywhere, but I really want to say is that our generation is so much harder than what the older generations went through. Why? Because our generation moves at a much faster pace than older generations. When my grandparents talked about having nothing back then like the internet, computers, or phones, I responded back with "You have them now, why don't you learn to use them?". The same old response is always "I'm old; I'm used to doing it the old way".</p>

	<p>I also want to mention that this is one of the reasons why universities and 4-year degrees will probably be instinct in the future. People will soon recognize in the future that things are moving at a much faster pace and society needs more small business owners than people who are simply content with working for someone else. I remember Professor Boviard said something like in 20-30 years everyone will be working for themselves.</p>

	<p>I think I have ranted enough about this generation gap. Hopefully my rants were not as messed as what I'm feeling right now; god! I hate this B07 project!</p>

	<p>There's Doctors, there's Lawyers, and then there's Engineers (STEM)</p>

	<p>First of all, STEM stands for Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics. For me, I would fall into mathematics as computer science is simply a branch of mathematics and more specifically the discrete and algorithmic branch. So what did you guess from that title? Well, I had a thought about those 3 professions. I realized in the end that the reason why Asian parents always encourage their kids to pursue those jobs is due to stability, and this stability is mainly due to the high employment rate which implies the stable job security of these professions.</p>

	<p>Let's start off with the doctor; it's pretty obvious since people who get sick need to get treated. Then there are lawyers, I really don't understand how lawyers can be stable, but apparently it's quite a stable profession from what I heard.</p>

	<p>Now onto the real topic of today's rant. Why do people assume engineers have a stable job? By the way when I refer to engineers I refer to computer engineers, chemical engineers, and etc… But like I was saying, engineers do not have stable jobs believe or not. It is so common for someone to assume all engineers can get a job, especially in North American culture and media. The reason is because…. Ok I'm just going to say it, white people can't do math. The common ground that everyone in North America shares is that everyone wants to go to arts school, become an actor, or pursue their dreams as an artist. This is of course ways different in China as everyone studies to become an engineer or will study something related to STEM. Competition in China is extremely rough, especially when it comes to getting into a good mathematics or technology school.</p>

	<p>Let's start with an example. A software engineer (me) will only have about 10 - 15 good years of solid income. After I turn 30 - 35 years old, I'm most likely not able to work as a developer or a programmer, in most cases, a person at that age falls off the radar as the technology changes. Say Java is popular now, in 10 years it might be obsolete. Usually when you turn 35, you are not able to compete with the other younger guys who can do things much faster than you. In my dad's case he went into the dark side (management) and project leader. For those who think that managers and project leaders somehow make more money than developers, they are wrong. Just because I tell you to do something doesn't mean I get paid more.</p>

	<p>Another example might be say… pure/theoretical mathematics, essentially any field that requires research. There's a reason why Einstein did not publish anything great after he turn 30. Reason is because with maturity comes lack of creativity. With any research oriented jobs, there's going to be a crucial period of time when someone is able to think just outside the box and come up with something great and original. Why? Because when a mathematician learns the rules of the game, he will most probably not want to break it.</p>

	<p>That is it for today's blog, I want to end this with a note that Asian parents who think their son or daughter (mainly son) becoming a programmer or developer is good, well think again, their careers last as long as an average career of a tennis player. No more than 10 years, that's assuming they start early.</p>

	<p>Sex in the Asian Culture</p>

	<p>I never talked about sex with my parents, not even once. Why? Because it's awkward!!! When I was growing up, I watched different T.V dramas. One thing I realized always was that North American T.V shows already put a huge emphasis on the implications of sexual intentions. There would always be some sort of sex jokes, or sex scenes that would catch the eye of the audience. However, in any Chinese T.V shows, it was almost impossible to see any of that.</p>

	<p>One thing I want to point out is that I was confused when I was younger as to the difference between cultures. Honestly, I still don't understand why sex is viewed differently in the Asian culture.</p>

	<p>What I really want to talk about however is my experience and what conclusion I have come to in the end after all these years of living in both worlds; the North American and Asian.</p>

	<p>I just want to give some common examples of movies and shows. First of all, any North American films or shows. Let's start with the movie <i>Titanc, </i>everyone should know this movie. The whole movie was about love, but the American producers and directors made the entire movie into a soft-core porno. All the way from the Jack and Rose's initial meet to the scene when they did it in the car, and finally the ending that naked painting scene.</p>

	<p>Now here is an example of a Chinese film called Love in Disguise (恋爱通告) starring Wonglee Hong. If you do not know the movie, it had the same Shakespearean concept of two people falling in love. It was a very cookie-cutter concept much like Twelfth Night, but it never was there a moment of explicit sexual tension. The only scenes in the movie that were considered "sexual" were the two main characters hugging and leaning on each other. There was no kiss scene or any sex scene involved in the movie whatsoever.</p>

	<p>Those are two good examples of the difference between Asian cultures when it comes to sex in the media. Main things to take away from are that there will never be any kissing or sex scenes from these movies as opposed to the North American side.</p>

	<p>Why your parents give bad career advice</p>

	<p>I wanted to add to my previous blog about the STEM jobs. Let's start off with the stereotype of Asian parents and them always wanting their kids to become doctors, lawyers, engineers. What I want to know is why is it that Asian parents have their eyes set on these professions?</p>

	<p>Here is my theory. If your parents were born before the 1970s, then this stereotype is quite common and acceptable. However, the question is why do your parents want you to get into STEM?</p>

	<p>Let's have a brief overlook of the history in places in Asia, in particular, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. This can go back all the way to pre Sino-Japanese war during world war 2, so I guess this was around the time of where most people's grandparents were growing up (for people around my age). These places were going through revolutions and wars were happening all over. There was no stability and/or enough food for anyone. The only way to secure stability was to be useful in certain specific fields.</p>

	<p>Most people would become farmers and/or find some sort of temporary jobs from time to time. These jobs included working at a fishing dock, carry heavy load, or maybe being a bus boy at a restaurant.</p>

	<p>Between the 1930s and 1950s, times were tough and there was little stability. When my grandparents grew up around these times, they wanted stability and they don't want to just have their kids to be on survival mode. My grandparents had nothing, but they saw everyday people like doctors, lawyers and engineers always had food and money in their picket and were no starving. So what happens? They get their kids (my parents) to go into specific fields like lawyers, doctors, and engineers in hopes that they don't have to suffer.</p>

	<p>So on my side of the family, my dad always tells me to follow my passion, but my mom always tells me to do something that is stable like being an engineer. Reason being was that my dad was forced to going into something he did not like, which is being an engineer. But my mom, she suffered greatly for not doing something like engineering or pharmacy and suffered for doing business studies (her passion).</p>

	<p>When my parents got married, their ideals got clashed. My mom was happy due to the stability of my dad's profession.</p>

	<p>So what do I think of this future generation? The generation where we do not have to think about surviving? It's simple, most parents will tell their kids to follow their passions. But I think the next step is not just following your passion, because now people understand that it is not logically acceptable to just do something you love. The next generation (my generation) will tell their kids to follow their passion while also making it economically profitable in the future.</p>

	<p>From useless to the most useful</p>

	<p>I was having a discussion the other day with my friends about the most useless degrees people can get. I also did some fun research on this topic, so I want to talk about what I think currently are some of the most useless degrees to some of the most useful degrees out there in today's economy. Although the media may portray all degrees as being equal, we all know that is not true.</p>

	<p>Let's start off with the most useful degrees. Anything engineering, computer, information, or medical degrees are quite useful. Why are they useful though? Well, these fields require very technical skills. For example, not anyone can program, but everyone can write an essay. You agree right?</p>

	<p>Now we move on to the not so useless degrees, the ones that are in between the useful and useless. First is business, it is a degree where there is a big mixture of soft and hard skills. Because business is so common and it is everywhere, it is regarded as useful in most people's eyes. In reality, you do not need to go to business school to learn how to start a business these days. Although it would help to know some formal concepts and experience the university life, it is definitely not necessary.</p>

	<p>Then there are the sciences. I'm talking about biology, chemistry, mental health studies. These are not completely useless because fields like nursing, pharmacy, and becoming a doctor are quite profitable. But having only a bachelor's degree in these fields is quite hard if you want a job just out of university. However, because the sciences is very government heavy based, extra education and certification beyond a bachelors is crucial or else it is almost impossible to land a job.</p>

	<p>Finally to my favorite part of this discussion; the most useless degrees out there. I'm talking about anything that has "studies" at the end in the program name. Things like social studies, civil studies, humanitarian studies, and anything that has studies. These are completely a waste of your money and time.</p>

	<p>Furthermore, anything related to philosophy, history, or language. These are so fricken useless and are not worth getting a degree in. Who needs a philosopher that talks about the meaning of life and existence with no scientific knowledge? No one needs to know the history of the world, it might be entertaining, but who needs to know that? As for language, language learning is best done by just totally immersing oneself into another culture and moving into a country that uses it.</p>

	<p>So here it was, my 2 cents on the most useful and useless degrees one can possibly get. If you read and think I was joking, well I'm not. The world is becoming more and more saturated with all these useless degrees. Sooner or later everyone will have one of these degrees, and sooner or later people will realize that getting a degree in something technical is much more productive than something that has nothing to do with the real world.</p>

	<p>Teenage Evolution in Nutshell</p>

	<p>Justin Bieber and Miley Cryus. Enough said.</p>

	<p>Throughout my teenage years, I have grown up with these two pop stars. I have never been a very big fan of either of these two. However, looking back again at my nostalgic and awesome childhood memories, I have something to say about these two celebrities.</p>

	<p>Let's start off with Justin Bieber; he was an innocent little boy who was discovered for her talent on YouTube. At some point I really wanted to like him only because he was Canadian. Going through puberty and voice changes throughout his career, also his hair style and his own public image, I can't help but feel like Justin Bieber is "evolving" just like the rest of us. Although he is portrayed as a "bad boy" nowadays, I started to view his life in his own perspective and realized that Justin Bieber is really not all that bad.</p>

	<p>Think of the stupid things you have done in your life. Some may be minor and some may be major. For Justin, it seems that anything he does is exponentially worse than it really is. For example, like the time where he smoked weed. I'm going to admit that I have never smoked weed before in my life, but I knew several people who just wanted to try it just for fun. No doubt it is not considered good to smoke good, but I can imagine that a nobody like me smoking weed can only find my parents to explain to. For Justin, he has to explain it to the world.</p>

	<p>From what I see in terms of responsibility, he has way too much. Just like his fans, he is a young adult who want to party and have fun. However his schedule is filled with concert tours, and interviews, and press conferences. It is almost impossible for him to have fun. Like that time he puked and passed out on the stage. It was only once because he probably had a hangover the night before and came to work a little tipsy and dizzy. Even for the average person, going to work with a hangover is hard, but for Justin, no can do sir, he has to be 100% fresh all the time or else he will disappoint his fans.</p>

	<p>I want to end this blog with a note on Miley Cyrus. She is definitely different from before, that's for sure. However, looking at her perspective, think about how much change there is, was, and will be from the age of 16 - 21. To put simply, she changed because she wanted to explore what she liked. Her music changed, is that really so bad? It is the equivalent from an art major changing to engineering and it is equivalent to a girl having curly hair change to straight hair.</p>

	<p>To sum up, I do not hate any of these celebrities, but this does not mean I like them. I just want to bring up the fact that the teenage years are full of changes, mistakes, craziness, and exploration of a person's life. We cannot have such high expectations of these celebrities and their behaviours.</p>

	<p>My favourite Lecture and My favourite theory in this Course!</p>

	<p>The title says it all. This is my second last blog post of the course. I have learned so much from just blogging twice a week. I might even continue to post these random blogs even after these course is done, who knows.</p>

	<p>I have learned a lot from the past 3 months and I want to simply summarize my favourite parts of the lecture, the readings, and my learning experience.</p>

	<p>My lecture definitely had to be the lecture where the queer theory was introduced. Why did I like that lecture so much? First of all, it had very little concepts to learn, and secondly I understood most of the beforehand. Thirdly, I was able to relate the materials in class to real life.</p>

	<p>The MacDonald's Commercial was definitely something that caught my mind. Why? It made me think of what hidden messages are out there. For me, if I was not taking this course and I watched that commercial, I would have probably never related to the commercial as a message to the gays. I probably would have thought that commercial was just about promoting MacDonald's to more people and that their breakfast menu became updated in style.</p>

	<p>Watching that one commercial made me realize that I have to be attentive when in comes to critiquing or analyzing different media artifacts. Analyzing and interpreting different media artifacts is a skill. From that lecture onwards, I started to pay more attention to the meaning and the message behind commercials. Not only commercials, but songs, music videos, short films, and other things related to our everyday media.</p>

	<p>What was my favourite theory? That would be easy, none of them and all of them. I realized that these theories in some ways mean nothing. All these can fall under one category, and that is the "media theory" or "analysis". Each theory provides such a good insight to an aspect of media. I have reviewed all these theories and to me, these can be applied to real life in many ways. For example, the Marxist theory was heavily applied during the China's civil wars and revolutions. Cultural Theory can be applied to my everyday experience at school and at work. And Psychoanalytical theory can be applied to what I watch and choose to watch on YouTube.</p>

	<p>Overall I really enjoyed taking this course and have learned a tremendous amount. Thanks Professor Petit.</p>

	<p>Final Blog - blogging is obsolete</p>

	<p>My previous blog, I sounded as if I was finished, however I have saved the best for last.</p>

	<p>In the recent months, YouTube has integrated Google+ in order to make both YouTube and Google+ more social and interactive for the viewers. Now, posts from YouTube can be shared in conjunction with Google+ and each channel must have their own unique Google+ page, basically a Facebook fan page.</p>

	<p>Blogging all these months, I realized that blogging has become old I the internet era. What is the new thing to go after? Vlogging of course (video logging).</p>

	<p>Let's take a brief look at YouTube. </p>

	<p>2005 - 2006</p>

	<p>People just started using YouTube and have no idea what it is. There were no rules, no copyright, just share. If you post a video up during this time and show your face, she might be scared of getting killed by others; at this stage sharing wasn't popular.</p>

	<p>2007 - 2008</p>

	<p>YouTube has generated some stars such as Kevjumba, Happyslip, Smosh etc… It has become a new platform of entertainment. Sharing at this stage has become more well known.</p>

	<p>2009-2010</p>

	<p>YouTube is s table in most people's lives, and most people at this stage would rather watch YouTube videos over Television. Advertisement and the YouTube Partner program have enabled people to view YouTube more as career in which they may earn money from.</p>

	<p>2011 - Onwards</p>

	<p>YouTube is the universal platform for video. If you don't know YouTube, then I feel sorry for you.</p>

	<p>So why has blogging become obsolete? Blogging was popular during the pre-YouTube era. Nowadays, people are more inclined to do video logs rather than writing up blog posts. It's simple really as to why people do this; our culture hates reading, and loves absorbing information through entertainment. We would rather watch a video than read a book.</p>

	<p>To put it in my own experience, video logging takes way less effort and when they say that pictures are worth a thousand words, well a video is worth a million words. There are just so many ways to express oneself through video than there is through words alone.</p>

	<p>This concludes Media Studies Blog, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I might actually miss doing these blogs on a regular basis. Hopefully I continue on.</p>
